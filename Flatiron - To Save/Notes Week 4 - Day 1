Managing Gem Dependencies
bundle init
  - sets project up to be bundler compatible

gem 'activerecord' (this just says you need the gem)
gem 'activerecord', '4.1' (this specifies the version you want)

Semantic Versioning 1.2.3

1) Major number (major release - allowed to be incompatible with lower versions)
2) Minor release (updates current version - has to be compatible with same version)
3) Patch (backwards compatible bug fixes)

#######Place in environment.rb file######
ENV["APP_ENV"] ||= "development"

require 'bundler/setup'
Bundler.require

require 'active_record' #this can't automatically load from the Bundler because the library and gem names are different
#######################################

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'sqlite3'

  :database => "db/student-#{ENV["APP_ENV"]}.db"
)

ActiveRecord is database agnostic library (as long as you're using a relational database)

ActiveRecord Migration is library AR gives you to run SQL commands.

migration files go in the db/migration folder

##########  01_create_students.rb (must define class called CreateStudents)  #######
class CreateStudents < ActiveRecord::Migration
end
################

File name has to correspond to the class name - replace underscores in file name  with camelcase in Class name

##########  01_create_students.rb #########
class CreateStudents < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up #how to add info to table
    #data for creating a table
  end

  def down #how to undo the update on the up method
    #data for removing a table
  end
end

Rake is a task oriented DSL

-ruby used for writing simple tasks

If you want a rake task you make a Rakefile (just like with the gemfile)

rake -T (shows all the rake tasks that can be run)

######### rakefile #########
desc "A Sample Rake Task"
task :sample do
  puts "I am a sample task"
  end

desc "Load your application in a console"
task :console do
  require_relative './config/environment'
end

namespace :db do
  desc "Migrate the DB"
  task :migrate do
   blah blah blah
  end
end
:namespace (allows us to group tasks together so the namespace shows up before the task in a rake list)

Full Stack Testing

describe "thing I want to do", :type => :feature :js => true do

This is how you tell rspec it's a feature test not a unit test

:js => true allows you to check the javascript elements of your suite too

Feature tests go in a features directory
  - should require spec_helper file
  - still _spec files

Feature specs should be expressed in terms of the user.  How things are used, not how they work (no inside variable testing)

Use Rack Test to controller test your controllers
  - mostly just test your routes.  If you want to include data in the tests, just do it in a feature test.

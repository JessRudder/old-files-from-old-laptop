Lecture Notes Week 2 - Day 1

#!/usr/bin/env ruby  <--- line of code that tells bash to open the file using the ruby interpreter.

Focus on creating structure then solving the smallest problem possible.

Nokogiri?
 - How do we get it working on our system?
 - Make sure to require the nokogiri gem
 - CSS selectors will be super key here
 - Works for scraping HTML -> You can then use Ruby to parse/mutate the output as you see fit

bug in the find documentation for Ruby (has detect as an example) <- could update documentation

when you want to chain blocks together you should use {} instead of do...end

Refer to Github Ruby style guide for style questions.

select, reject & collect => family of filters (return a modified array)

all?  The second one element makes the block evaluate to false, the whole thing returns false.
any?  If just one element in the block has evaluates to true, the whole thing returns true.
none?  Only returns true if every single iteration of the block returns false.

is_a? -> checks the type of an element

### Check This Out - See if Works
#  def my_none?(array)          #
#    answer = true              #
#    array.each do |i|          #
#      if yield(i)              #
#        return false           #
#      end                      #
#    end                        #
#  end                          #
#                               #
#  my_none?([1,2,3]) do |i|     #
#    i.even?                    #
#  end                          #

pry is a ruby gem
 - a REPL replacement (replaces REPLs like IRB)
 - drop into pry by 'binding.pry' <- put this in your code where you want to 'drop in'
        - 'c' tells pry to continue until it gets to the next loop (maybe exit b/c 'c'/'next' didn't seem to work)

system('ls') - in IRB (ruby) it will send the command to bash and print the results

When you need to know what data is on different levels of a nested structure, you should use hashes instead of arrays.

Need to define the 'events' that you want to report on:
1) button clicks
2) add to cart
3) paying

Adapter pattern
- we send data to segement.io
- segment.io replicates it across your chosen services

Track session ids because they're always unique
  - no other user on your website will ever have that unique session id

Track on front end is much more powerful because you have more access to user data (browser, etc)

Have a helper delegate to a partial
 - Don't want any HTML in helpers (can be done but no reason to)

Have a view delegate content to be dropped into a partial (Avi's not sure he likes how he's using it right now)
 - sublayouts/content for blocks
 - this is done a lot for things like telling the footer which page you're on, 
 - if you call it with a block, Rails assumes you're defining what is going to be called later, if you call it without a block Rails assumes you're calling what has been defined

Incognito window will give you a new session in rails every time

Don't redirect to a thank you page - render it.  If someone refreshes the page, it can mess up your analytics.


Testing tracking with RSPEC is difficult

View object - concept in model view controllers
 - presenter is alternate name

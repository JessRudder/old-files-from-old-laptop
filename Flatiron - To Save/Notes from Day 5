When you see:

  new_array = []

  original_array.each do |member|
    empty_array << member
  end

  return new_array

You should probably be using

original_array.collect

array.shift returns the 0th item and removes it from the array

<< and .push are aliases of the same method.  << is concerned to be favorable (looks cleaner)

in irb _ is the last return value (in case you make a mistake and forgot to grab that return in a variable!)

You Need to Know:
pop, shift and push #You will use them every day!

.permutation (returns all the permutations of an array)  # Could be useful for the flight planning project!

normalizing and de-nomalizing data is something you work with a lot as a programmer (look up common methods used to do this)!

Keys and Values in a hash do not exist without each other.

"using a hash rocket is so much fun"

items can be chained onto the end of a method

def some_method()
  code
  code
  code
end.compact

detect returns first element for which the block returns true.

Select returns all elements for which the block returns true.

{} if block will fit on one line or if you're going to chain something on the end of the block

do...end if block will be multi-line
